# Chuckles

## Description
This program was developed during brainstorming of Project 1, we were told to do a stand-up when we met with one another. Therefore, we created a stand-up app from old school nostalgia. Nobody has heard a good Chuck Norris joke in years. Dad jokes, are never out of style.  


## Usage
Are you an aspiring late 90'0s/early 2000's stand up comic? Do you need content?
As a user I want to quickly look up some good chuck norris and dad jokes so that I can be funny. 
As a user I want to be able to see previous jokes at a glance in case I momentarily forget it. 
As a user I want to be able to clear it once the jokes have been used so that people think im original.
